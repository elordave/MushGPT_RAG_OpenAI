# MushGPT

MushGPT is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer environmental and ecological questions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology and the OpenAI API (currently utilizing GPT-3.5-turbo). The primary objective is to provide accurate and cost-effective responses based on verified data.

---

## Features
- **RAG-Based Response System**: Ensures answers are grounded in reliable, domain-specific knowledge.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Provides a lightweight and efficient API for query handling.
- **Vite + React Frontend**: Offers a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Docker Deployment**: Easily deployable using Docker and Docker Compose.

---

## How It Works
1. **User Query Submission**: Users input environmental or ecological questions via the frontend.
2. **Processing in FastAPI**:
   - The query is received and formatted.
   - The system interacts with a structured database using `langchain` to retrieve relevant information.
   - The OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo) processes the query using predefined prompt templates.
3. **Response Generation**: The chatbot returns a concise and informative response based on the retrieved knowledge.

## Project Structure
- **Backend**: FastAPI application handling API requests and responses.
- **Frontend**: Vite + React-based UI for user interaction.
- **Database**: Stores verified environmental data used for augmenting chatbot responses.
- **Docker Integration**: Simplifies setup and deployment.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker**

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
